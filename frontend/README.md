This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Deployment Readiness

This frontend is configured for production deployment. It builds successfully and uses a safe production API fallback so it does not crash if `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is not set immediately.

### Recommended Environment Variables

Create/update `.env.production` (or your platform environment settings):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMPANY_PHONE=+92 335 5111150
```

Notes:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is recommended for production deployments when the backend is hosted on a different domain.
- If it is not configured, the app falls back to `/api` in production and `http://localhost:5000/api` in development.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMPANY_PHONE` is optional and has a fallback value in the UI.

### Production Commands

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run start
```

If port `3000` is in use:

```bash
npm run start -- -p 3001
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
